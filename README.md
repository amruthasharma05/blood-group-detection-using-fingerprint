# blood-group-detection-using-fingerprint
This Project focuses on Predicting the people's blood group without taking the samples of blood, instead collecting the biometric like fingerprint with the help of deep learning model.

##About this Project
This project focuses on predicting a person's blood group using fingerprint images with the help of image processing and deep learning techniques. Fingerprint images are processed using CNN for preprocessing and feature enhancement. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is then trained to classify fingerprint patterns into different blood group categories. The dataset used for training and testing was obtained from Kaggle. This project was developed as an academic project to explore the application of deep learning and image processing in healthcare-related domains.
